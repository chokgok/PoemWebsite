Winter is here
chokgok

Sunlight is beginning to fade.
Winter is on it's way.
No more falling in leaves.
Rather loads of wreaths.
We had our Thanksgiving celebration.
Now Christmas is all over the nation.
Say goodbye the season of fall.
Say hello to the Santa in the mall.

I know this is plain text.
But I'm too lazy for hypertext.
